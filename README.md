This project is for educational purposes.
🎓 Student Performance Prediction System using ML Algorithms
📌 Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning system that predicts student academic performance as High, Medium, or Low based on various indicators such as attendance, past scores, and behavioral metrics. A clean and interactive Streamlit dashboard is also developed to demonstrate real-time predictions.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze and clean student-related academic data
Identify key performance indicators (KPIs)
Train classification models to predict performance level
Build a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard
Maintain clear documentation and GitHub structure
